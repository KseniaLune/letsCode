Solved problems from the leetcode <br>
Sometimes the problems are repetitive, sometimes they contain multiple solutions <br>
The solutions are not always optimal<br>
Sometimes the number of cycles can go beyond what is reasonable<br>
But it works<br>
Someday, after thousands of solved problems, it will not be me who finds optimal solutions,<br>
but they will find me.<br>
