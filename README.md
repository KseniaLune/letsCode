Solved problems from the leetcode
Sometimes the problems are repetitive, sometimes they contain multiple solutions
The solutions are not always optimal
Sometimes the number of cycles can go beyond what is reasonable
But it works
Someday, after thousands of solved problems, it will not be me who finds optimal solutions,
but they will find me.
